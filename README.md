# mitocw600SC
### Created by: Sangwook Cheon

During the summer break, moving from 8th 
grade to high school, I took MIT opencourseware 600SC. 
This course was provided free by Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 

The programs were created locally using PyCharm, 
and I transferred al the files to Github using Version Control.
